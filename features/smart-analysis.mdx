## Overview

Smart Analysis is SkoutLab's core capability — transforming raw data into actionable insights through AI-powered hypothesis generation and validation.

## How It's Different

| Traditional BI | SkoutLab |
|----------------|----------|
| You build dashboards | AI explores for you |
| You write queries | You ask questions |
| Charts to interpret | Findings explained |
| Manual exploration | Automated discovery |

## Analysis Modes

### Question-Driven

Ask a specific question and get a focused analysis:

> "Why did customer churn increase in Q4?"

SkoutLab will:
1. Identify relevant data
2. Generate hypotheses about causes
3. Test each hypothesis
4. Report validated findings

### Exploratory

Don't know what to ask? Let SkoutLab explore:

> "What's interesting in our sales data?"

The AI will:
1. Scan for patterns and anomalies
2. Identify significant trends
3. Surface unexpected relationships
4. Highlight areas needing attention

## The Analysis Process

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step 1: Understanding Context">
    SkoutLab uses Knowledge Builder's learnings to understand:
    - What metrics matter
    - How tables relate
    - What's "normal" for your data
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Step 2: Hypothesis Generation">
    Based on your question (or general exploration), AI generates testable hypotheses:
    - "Revenue dropped because of Product X"
    - "Churn correlates with support ticket volume"
    - "Sales peak on Tuesdays"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Step 3: Statistical Validation">
    Each hypothesis is rigorously tested:
    - Significance testing
    - Effect size calculation
    - Confidence intervals
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Step 4: Synthesis">
    Results are compiled into a report:
    - Key findings ranked by impact
    - Evidence for each finding
    - Recommended next steps
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Analysis Settings

When creating a task, you can configure:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Data Sources** | Which connections to analyze |
| **Question** | Your specific question (optional) |
| **Depth** | How many hypotheses to generate |
