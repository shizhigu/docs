description: Let AI analysts explore your data, test ideas, and brief you

## Overview

Smart Analysis is the experience of working with a tireless analyst. You describe what you want to learn (or simply ask SkoutLab to explore) and a team of agents handles:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Exploration" icon="map">
    Agents map tables, track lineage, and understand what “normal” looks like using Knowledge Builder.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Hypothesis Lab" icon="flask">
    Potential explanations are generated automatically—each one is testable.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Validation" icon="chart-line">
    Statistical notebooks run in parallel to confirm or refute every hypothesis.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Briefing" icon="clipboard-check">
    Findings are ranked by impact and translated into plain language with next steps.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Modes You Can Run

### Question-driven
Provide context such as “Why did revenue drop in Q4?” Agents focus on that metric/time period and return a focused briefing.

### Exploratory
Leave the prompt blank and let the agents scout for anything noteworthy—anomalies, breakouts, seasonality, or risk indicators.

### Follow-up
From any finding, click **Investigate Further**. SkoutLab clones the context and dives deeper without you rebuilding filters or prompts.

## Behind the Scenes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Understand context">
    Knowledge Builder’s learnings (schemas, joins, synonyms) guide agents to the right tables and metrics.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Generate hypotheses">
    Statements such as “Enterprise deals slipped 18%” or “Product X win rate dropped” are drafted automatically.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Validate statistically">
    Each hypothesis gets a notebook that runs significance tests, calculates effect sizes, and produces charts/data samples.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="4. Synthesize">
    Confirmed items become Findings, refuted ones document what’s *not* happening, and inconclusive ones suggest data gaps.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Working in the Report Viewer

- **View modes:** Board (risk/opportunity columns), List (dense table with sorting), Topics (clustered by AI-generated themes).
- **Filters:** Status, impact, topic, agent, significance. Combine them to hone in on the knottiest issues.
- **Drawer:** Clicking a finding opens the narrative, charts, statistics, and workspace downloads.

## Settings to Tune

| Setting | What it controls |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Data Sources** | Choose which connections are included. SkoutLab handles joins automatically. |
| **Prompt** | Natural-language question or context (optional). |
| **Depth** | How many hypotheses each agent should pursue. |
| **Mode** | Exploratory vs question-driven. |
| **Sensitive fields** | Columns you want the AI to ignore (PII, salaries, etc.). |

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start broad" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Run an exploratory sweep to see what the AI finds before narrowing the scope.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Provide context" icon="comment">
    Mention timeframes (“Q4 vs Q3”), segments, or metrics to cut noise.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Iterate" icon="rotate">
    Use follow-up analyses to drill down instead of starting from scratch.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review evidence" icon="chart-column">
    Every finding links to the generated charts/notebooks so you can audit the work.
  </Card>
