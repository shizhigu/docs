## What You Receive

Every Smart Analysis produces a living report built for decision-makers:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Executive summary** | Top takeaways, overall assessment (opportunity/risk/stable), and quick actions. |
| **Findings board** | Hypotheses grouped by category with impact scores. |
| **Evidence drawer** | Charts, metrics, and workspace files backing each statement. |
| **History** | Past runs for the same question, with diffs. |

## Reading the Findings

- **Status badge** tells you whether the hypothesis was Confirmed, Refuted, or is Inconclusive.
- **Impact chip** indicates Critical / High / Medium / Low based on business effect.
- **Excerpt** summarizes the “why” in one sentence.
- **Quick actions** offer follow-ups (“Investigate further”, “Download evidence”, “Schedule”).

<Tip>
Switch between **Board**, **List**, and **Topics** view to see findings the way you need—executive overview, detailed table, or thematic clusters.
</Tip>

## Evidence Drawer

Click any card to open the drawer. You’ll find:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Narrative" icon="paragraph">
    Plain-language explanation of the result and its business impact.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Charts & metrics" icon="chart-line">
    Auto-generated visualizations, p-values, effect sizes, sample sizes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Workspace links" icon="folder-open">
    Downloadable notebooks, CSV samples, and chart images for auditing.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Use **Download Evidence Package** to grab everything for that hypothesis as a zip, or jump to the [Evidence Workspace](/features/workspace) for more options.
