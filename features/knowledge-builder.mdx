## What is Knowledge Builder?

Knowledge Builder is SkoutLab's continuous learning system. Once you connect data, it works in the background to:

- **Understand** your data structure and relationships
- **Monitor** for changes, anomalies, and trends
- **Build** institutional knowledge about your business

<Tip>
Think of it as an analyst who's always reviewing your data, even when you're not asking questions.
</Tip>

## How It Works

When you click **Start Learning**, Knowledge Builder begins a continuous cycle:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Schema Discovery">
    Scans all tables, columns, and data types. Identifies primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Semantic Understanding">
    Goes beyond schema to understand what fields mean:
    - "revenue" vs "sales" vs "income" — same concept?
    - Status codes: what does "1", "2", "3" mean?
    - Currency fields: USD? Local currency?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pattern Recognition">
    Finds common patterns in your data:
    - Typical value ranges
    - Seasonal trends
    - Normal vs abnormal distributions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Continuous Monitoring">
    Watches for changes and anomalies:
    - New data arriving
    - Unexpected values
    - Schema changes
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Knowledge Builder Creates

### Data Understanding

For each data source, Knowledge Builder documents:

| Knowledge Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Structure** | Tables, columns, relationships |
| **Semantics** | What fields actually mean in business terms |
| **Quality** | Data issues, missing values, inconsistencies |
| **Patterns** | Common query patterns and best practices |

### Alerts & Insights

Knowledge Builder can detect:

- **Schema changes** — New columns, dropped tables
- **Data freshness issues** — Data not updating as expected
- **Anomalies** — Values outside normal ranges
- **Quality degradation** — Increasing null rates, duplicates

## Starting Knowledge Builder

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Data Page">
    Navigate to the Data section in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Start Learning">
    Click the **Start Learning** button in the Knowledge Builder panel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Let It Run">
    Knowledge Builder runs continuously in the background. You can stop it anytime.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Knowledge Builder uses compute resources while running. For cost efficiency, you may want to run it periodically rather than continuously, especially for large datasets.
</Warning>

## Benefits for Analysis

When you create an analysis task, Knowledge Builder's learning improves results:

- **Faster analysis** — AI already knows your data structure
- **Better accuracy** — Understanding of business semantics
- **Fewer errors** — Awareness of data quality issues
- **Richer insights** — Historical context and patterns
