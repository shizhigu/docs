title: Evidence Workspace
description: Download charts, code, and data from every analysis
---

Every analysis produces a **workspace** inside SkoutLab. Think of it as the analyst’s notebook: the SQL, charts, notebooks, and exports generated while testing hypotheses. This page shows how to use it.

## Accessing the Workspace

From any report:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a finding">
    Click a hypothesis card to open the drawer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Evidence">
    Scroll past the narrative to see charts, tables, and the “Evidence Package” button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download">
    Choose **Download Workspace** to grab everything for that hypothesis, or **Download Evidence Package** to get a zip of the curated artifacts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What’s Inside an Evidence Package

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `notebooks/analysis.py` | Generated Python notebook or script used during validation. |
| `charts/*.png` | High-resolution charts referenced in the report. |
| `summary.md` | Markdown summary of the finding and statistics. |
| `data-samples.csv` | Anonymized sample rows supporting the hypothesis. |

Packages are zipped so you can archive them, attach to tickets, or send to auditors.

## Live Workspace Files

You can also browse workspace files without downloading:

<Image src="/images/checks-passed.png" alt="Workspace file browser" />

- **Charts API** – `/api/charts/...` streams chart images so the UI loads quickly.
- **Workspace Files API** – `/api/workspace-files/...` returns the list of scripts/notebooks generated.
- **Evidence Package API** – `/api/evidence-package/...` bundles everything server-side before downloading.

All routes require auth and automatically include your `X-User-ID`, so only the owner of an analysis can fetch its workspace.

## When to Use It

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Audit & Compliance" icon="shield">
    Keep the evidence zip as proof of how numbers were produced.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Handoff to Data Team" icon="people-group">
    Share the notebook/SQL so engineers can productionize a finding.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Manual Deep-Dive" icon="microscope">
    Open the raw workspace if you want to rerun or tweak the analysis locally.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Tips

- Each hypothesis has its own workspace. Download only what you need.
- The zip includes metadata (analysis ID, hypothesis ID) so files are traceable.
- Workspace files are kept for the lifetime of the analysis. Deleting the report removes the workspace immediately.
