title: Automation & Scheduled Analyses
description: Let AI agents rerun investigations on a cadence without manual effort
---

SkoutLab can do more than one-off analyses. Automation keeps critical investigations running on a cadence so teams always receive fresh context without re-triggering tasks by hand.

## Components

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Knowledge Builder" icon="brain" href="/features/knowledge-builder">
    Learns schema, semantics, and historical baselines.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Continuous Learning Panel" icon="waveform">
    Control background learning cycles from the Data page.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scheduled Tasks" icon="calendar">
    Run recurring analyses (weekly/monthly) for key metrics.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Continuous Learning

Once you enable the **Knowledge Builder**:

- Agents periodically re-scan connections to keep their understanding fresh.
- Learning passes capture schema changes and quality notes that downstream analyses can reference.
- The learning badge shows when the last pass completed so you know how current the context is.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable">
    From **Data → Knowledge Builder**, click **Start Learning**. Choose full-auto (find issues + auto-run analyses) or semi-auto (queue recommendations for approval).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review">
    The panel shows status (`Learning`, `Idle`, `Error`). Errors include log links so you can retry after fixing credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pause">
    Click **Stop** to release compute if you only need periodic learning.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Scheduled Tasks

Create automated runs from the Reports page or the Tasks API:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Type** | `immediate`, `weekly`, `monthly` |
| **Schedule** | e.g., `weekly_monday`, `monthly_1st` |
| **Focus area** | Optional notes (“Watch enterprise churn”) |
| **Connections** | Which data sources to use |

<Tip>
Set up a weekly “Revenue Health” task. SkoutLab will rerun the analysis, compare to prior results, and highlight what changed.
</Tip>

## Alerts & Notifications

- **Dashboard badges** show active tasks or learning sessions.
- **Report diffing** highlights what changed since the last run.
- **Coming soon**: email / Slack alerts for critical findings.

## When to Use Automation

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Critical KPIs" icon="heart-pulse">
    Revenue, churn, inventory, or operational metrics that deserve a recurring deep-dive.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data Quality Context" icon="binoculars">
    Keep Knowledge Builder running so analyses understand new columns or refresh gaps.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Quarterly Briefings" icon="calendar-days">
    Schedule deep-dives ahead of board meetings.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Experiment Tracking" icon="flask">
    Automate follow-up analyses for A/B tests or pilots.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Operational Checklist

1. **Name owners** for each scheduled task so alerts go somewhere.
2. **Document** cadence and focus in the task description.
3. **Review** the report history monthly to retire tasks that are no longer useful.
4. **Combine** automation with manual “Investigate Further” runs when something interesting pops up.
