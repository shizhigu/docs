## Multi-Source Analysis

SkoutLab excels at analyzing data across multiple sources:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cross-Reference" icon="link">
    Find relationships between different data sources automatically
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unified View" icon="layer-group">
    Ask questions that span multiple datasets
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Example:** Connect your CRM data and financial data, then ask:
> "Which customer segments have the highest lifetime value?"

SkoutLab will automatically join and analyze data from both sources.
