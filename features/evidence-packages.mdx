title: Evidence Packages
description: Export notebooks, SQL, and charts from every analysis
---

Every investigation leaves a trail of artifacts—SQL queries, notebooks, charts, and sampling notes. SkoutLab bundles those files into **Evidence Packages** so teams can review or re-run the work without digging through the UI. Use this page to understand how to grab the package you need.

## Access a Package

From any report:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a finding">
    Click a hypothesis card to expand its drawer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review evidence">
    Scroll past the narrative until you reach the evidence attachments section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download">
    Choose **Download Evidence Package** to grab a zip of everything created for that hypothesis.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Packages download instantly so you can attach them to tickets, upload to shared drives, or archive for audit purposes.

## What’s Inside

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `notebooks/analysis.py` | Generated Python notebook or script used to validate the hypothesis. |
| `charts/*.png` | High-resolution PNG exports for every visualization referenced in the report. |
| `summary.md` | Markdown description of the finding, metrics, and confidence level. |
| `data-samples.csv` | Anonymized sample rows that back up the insight. |

Each file is labeled with the analysis ID and hypothesis ID so you can trace it back to the original run.

## APIs for Automation

- **Charts API** – `/api/charts/...` streams chart images for embedding elsewhere.
- **Evidence Files API** – `/api/workspace-files/...` lists the generated notebooks or scripts.
- **Evidence Package API** – `/api/evidence-package/...` zips and serves the entire artifact set.

All endpoints enforce `X-User-ID` headers for ownership checks, so only the creator (or an explicitly shared account) can fetch these assets.

## When It Helps

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Audit & Compliance" icon="shield">
    Keep the evidence zip as proof of how the KPI or report was produced.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data Team Handoffs" icon="people-group">
    Share the notebook/SQL so engineers can productionize the logic.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Manual Deep-Dives" icon="microscope">
    Pull everything locally if you want to rerun or extend the experiment.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Tips

- Each hypothesis has its own package—download only what your workflow needs.
- Files stick around for the lifetime of the analysis; deleting the report removes the associated evidence immediately.
- Use the APIs above if you want to mirror packages into your own storage bucket.
