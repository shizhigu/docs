## Report Structure

Every SkoutLab analysis produces a structured report designed for action, not just information.

### Executive Summary

At the top of each report, you'll find:

- **Key takeaways** — The 3-5 most important findings
- **Overall assessment** — Risk, opportunity, or status quo
- **Recommended actions** — What to do next

### Individual Findings

Each finding is a validated hypothesis with:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Status Badge">
    - **Confirmed** — Statistical evidence supports this finding
    - **Refuted** — Data contradicts the hypothesis
    - **Inconclusive** — More data needed
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Impact Score">
    Business significance rated from Low to Critical, based on:
    - Financial impact
    - Scope (how much data affected)
    - Urgency
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Evidence Section">
    - Visualizations (charts, graphs)
    - Statistical metrics (p-values, confidence intervals)
    - Data samples supporting the conclusion
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Next Steps">
    - **Investigate** — Questions to explore further
    - **Action** — Concrete steps to take
    - **Verify** — How to confirm the finding
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Interpreting Findings

### What "Confirmed" Means

When SkoutLab marks a finding as **Confirmed**, it means:

- The pattern exists in your data (not random chance)
- Statistical tests passed significance thresholds
- The finding is reproducible

<Info>
SkoutLab uses a significance level of 0.05 by default — meaning there's less than 5% probability the finding is due to chance.

### Understanding Impact

| Impact Level | What It Means |
|--------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Requires immediate attention; significant business risk or opportunity |
| **High** | Important finding that should inform decisions |
| **Medium** | Worth noting; may warrant follow-up |
| **Low** | Informational; no immediate action needed |
