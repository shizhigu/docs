  <Accordion title="1. Explore Your Data">
    The AI scans your data to understand its structure, identify key metrics, and find potential areas of interest.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Generate Hypotheses">
    Based on patterns found, the AI formulates testable hypotheses like:
    - "Revenue declined because Product X underperformed"
    - "Customer churn increased in Segment Y"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Validate with Statistics">
    Each hypothesis is rigorously tested with statistical analysis to ensure findings are significant, not random noise.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="4. Synthesize Results">
    Findings are ranked by business impact and compiled into an actionable report.
