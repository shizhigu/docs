description: Manage uploads, databases, and Knowledge Builder in one place

The **Data** page is where everything begins. It gives you a single workspace to:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="See every connection" icon="folder">
    Files, warehouses, and knowledge status at a glance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Control Knowledge Builder" icon="brain">
    Start/stop continuous learning and monitor activity.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stage evidence" icon="file-chart-column">
    Upload supporting files or manage workspace artifacts for reports.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Page Layout

<Image src="/images/hero-light.png" alt="Data Workspace layout" />

| Area | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Knowledge Builder panel** | Shows whether continuous learning is running, last refresh, and error states. |
| **Database connections** | Cards for each warehouse/source with status, last sync, and quick actions. |
| **Uploaded files** | Drag-and-drop zone plus a list of file-based datasets. |

## Adding Data

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload files">
    - Click **Add Connection → File Upload**
    - Drop Excel/CSV/Parquet files or select them from your computer
    - SkoutLab automatically extracts schema metadata and file stats
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect a warehouse">
    - Click **Add Connection → Database**
    - Enter connection credentials (host, DB, username, password/token)
    - Use **Test Connection** to validate before saving
    - SkoutLab stores credentials encrypted and only reads data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name & tag">
    Use descriptive names like “CRM – Prod” or “Finance – Actuals” so analyses are easy to target.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
You can connect multiple sources at once. Analyses can span uploads *and* live databases without manual joins.
</Tip>

## Knowledge Builder Controls

The Knowledge Builder panel mirrors the Continuous Learning toggle in the app:

| State | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **Idle** | Waiting for you to click **Start Learning**. |
| **Learning…** | Agents are crawling schema, profiling values, and updating the knowledge graph. |
| **Error** | Credentials expired or data proxy unavailable. Click **View Logs** for details. |

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start">
    Click **Start Learning**. The panel shows progress counters (tables scanned, insights learned) and next scheduled pass.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor">
    If you leave the page, the badge in the sidebar keeps showing whether learning is active.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stop">
    Hit **Stop** any time. Sessions finish their current pass and then release compute resources.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Running continuous learning consumes compute. For large warehouses, consider scheduled runs (daily/weekly) using the automation guide.
</Warning>

## Connection Management

Each connection card exposes quick actions:

- **Upload files** directly into that connection
- **Trigger test** to verify credentials still work
- **Open config** to rename, update tokens, or remove
- **Download evidence** from previous analyses (for file connections)

<Tip>
After uploading or deleting files via the modals, the list refreshes automatically—no page reload needed.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

- Keep production and sandbox data separate so you can target the right environment when asking questions.
- Use the description field to note refresh cadence or owner (“Updated nightly via Airflow”).
- Let Knowledge Builder finish at least one full pass before running exploratory analyses—it improves speed and accuracy.
