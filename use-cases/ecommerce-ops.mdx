## Overview

Commerce journeys span ads → onsite behavior → checkout → fulfillment → repeat purchase. SkoutLab's agents trace that chain end-to-end, cross-checking historical patterns so they can launch targeted analyses the moment a KPI looks strange. The goal is not real-time alerting but fast, defensible explanations of *why* a metric moved.

## Typical Flow

1. **Unified Data Workspace** – Connect ad platforms (Meta, Google), site/app telemetry (GA4, Snowplow), order & inventory systems, logistics data, and support tools. The workspace keeps refresh timestamps so each analysis knows which partitions are safe to use.
2. **Business Intent Setup** – Describe the metrics that matter (conversion rate, AOV, gross margin, return rate, stockouts). Agents derive seasonal baselines and auto-segment by campaign, device, SKU, warehouse, or customer type.
3. **Agent Exploration** – At the first sign of an anomaly, agents fork an analysis: they compare funnels, tie SKU performance to media spend, inspect search terms, or overlay fulfillment latency. Hypotheses that survive are bundled with statistics and sourcing SQL.
4. **Insight Delivery** – Reports document the causal chain, financial impact, related SKUs/audiences, and recommended actions. Evidence packages contain SQL/notebooks, top complaint excerpts, and inventory snapshots so merchandising, product, and ops teams can act immediately.

## Scenario: Weekend Conversion Rate Crash

| Stage | What agents do | Artifacts you receive |
|-------|----------------|-----------------------|
| Detection | Mobile conversion fell to 1.8% vs. a 30-day average of 2.6% | Heads-up message listing affected device + traffic mix |
| Diagnosis | Crossed campaigns, landing pages, SKUs, and browsers; found iOS Safari users failing checkout step 2 (p < 0.01) | Report section with funnel visualization, statistical output, and code links |
| Evidence | Workspace bundle includes network log samples, impacted order IDs, payment-service latency chart, and SKU revenue deltas | Engineers + growth teams can reproduce the issue in minutes |
| Follow-up | Auto-creates a "Checkout Experience" analysis that reruns daily for three days after the fix | Confirms whether the remediation worked |

## Required Data

| Source | Why it matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Advertising & Spend** | Tie CAC/ROAS swings back to channel, creative, and audience choices |
| **Web/App Behavior** | Track funnel steps, device performance, search/recommendation interactions |
| **Orders & Inventory** | Measure SKU-level revenue, margins, discounts, stock positions |
| **Logistics & CX** | Shipping SLAs, returns, NPS, ticket themes, refund drivers |

## Questions Agents Can Answer

```
"Which channel drove the CAC spike this week and what changed inside that campaign?"
"Why did AOV drop in North America, and which SKUs are responsible?"
"How much revenue did stockouts cost us compared to rerouted spend?"
"Which customer complaints map to higher return probability?"
"Did the latest promotion actually improve first-purchase-to-repeat conversion?"
```

## Operating Tips

- **Mix time grains** – Use hourly analyses for funnel metrics and daily runs for inventory/logistics to balance noise vs. insight.
- **Assign owners** – Pipe each agent-generated analysis into your issue tracker or planning board so teams close the loop.
- **Log business calendar events** – Record major promos, policy changes, or fulfillment constraints in the workspace; agents reference them to explain shifts instead of flagging false positives.
