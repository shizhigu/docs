## Sample Questions to Try

```
"What's causing the variance between actual and budgeted expenses?"

"Which cost categories are growing faster than revenue?"

"Are there any unusual transactions this month?"

"How do our unit economics compare to 6 months ago?"

"What's driving the change in customer acquisition cost?"
```
