description: Keep ARR, retention, and product signals under autonomous analysis
---

## Overview

SaaS economics are tightly coupled: acquisition, conversion, adoption, retention, and billing all influence each other. SkoutLab deploys a network of autonomous agents that continuously study those relationships. When a signal drifts, agents spin up their own investigation and deliver evidence before you even open a dashboard.

## Core Workflow

1. **Connect & Map** – Plug Stripe/Chargebee, your CRM pipeline, product analytics (Segment, Snowplow, Amplitude), and support tools into the Data Workspace. Knowledge Builder keeps learning every table's refresh cadence, lineage, and semantics so analyses always have current context.
2. **Define Business Lenses** – Tell SkoutLab which views deserve the most attention (ARR, net retention, onboarding completion, PQL volume, activation milestones). Agents derive baselines from history and compare sub-segments automatically.
3. **Agent-Led Analysis** – When a KPI deviates, agents create a task that drafts hypotheses, runs cohort and statistical tests, inspects product usage, and lines up possible causes. SQL, notebooks, and charts land in downloadable Evidence Packages for auditability.
4. **Brief & Act** – Findings are packaged as "insight → impact → next steps" and routed to GTM, Product, or CS leads. Subscribe any analysis to rerun weekly/monthly so leadership always has a fresh brief.

## Example: Net Retention Slips for Two Weeks

| Phase | Agent behavior | What you receive |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| Detect | Net retention stayed below 100% for two consecutive weeks, ~4.2σ below the 90-day rolling mean | Slack/Email heads-up naming the metric and affected customer cohort |
| Explore | 1,000+ hypotheses tested across geography, segment, plan, usage depth. Result: US SMB customers on the Scale plan drove 70% of the drop | Report call-out summarizing this cohort and the statistical confidence |
| Evidence | Package includes SQL for churn cohort, cancellation reason bar chart, feature-usage heatmap, and list of high-risk accounts | CS team can jump straight into outreach without rebuilding queries |
| Follow-up | Automation sets a recurring "SMB NRR Watch" analysis and pushes risky accounts into the CRM playbook | Ensures the issue stays visible until it recovers |

## Required Data

| Source | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Billing / Subscription** | ARR/MRR, upgrades, downgrades, contract duration, discounts |
| **CRM / Opportunity** | Pipeline stage, owner, win rate, renewal status |
| **Product Analytics** | Feature adoption, seat utilization, onboarding funnel, usage frequency |
| **Support / Health** | Ticket themes, NPS, CSM health scores, renewal risk flags |

## Questions Agents Can Answer

```
"Why did net retention fall below 100% this month?"
"Which accounts churn within 14 days of trial activation?"
"What behaviors separate this week's PQLs from last week's?"
"Is feature adoption leading paid expansion for a specific segment?"
"Do CSM touchpoints correlate with renewal probability?"
```

## Best Practices

- **Be explicit about lenses** – Tag KPIs, cohorts, products, or milestones you care about so agents prioritize those cuts.
- **Upload business context** – Strategy notes, pricing changes, and rollout memos help agents explain *why* a shift occurred.
- **Subscribe to key analyses** – Turn critical briefs into scheduled runs to keep leadership aligned without manual rework.
