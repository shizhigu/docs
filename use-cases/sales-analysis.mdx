## Example: Revenue Drop Investigation

**Question asked:**
> "Why did Q4 revenue drop compared to Q3?"

**What SkoutLab found:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Finding 1: Enterprise segment declined 23%">
    **Status:** Confirmed (p < 0.01)

    The Enterprise segment dropped from $2.1M to $1.6M. Further investigation showed 3 large renewals pushed to Q1.

    **Recommended action:** Review pipeline for delayed Enterprise deals
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Finding 2: New product launch underperformed">
    **Status:** Confirmed (p < 0.05)

    Product X launched in Q4 but achieved only 40% of forecast. Win rate for Product X deals: 12% vs 34% company average.

    **Recommended action:** Investigate Product X competitive positioning
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Finding 3: Seasonal effect — normal pattern">
    **Status:** Confirmed

    Q4 shows 8-12% seasonal dip in prior years. Current drop is within historical range when adjusted for Enterprise timing.

    **Recommended action:** No action needed — expected pattern
