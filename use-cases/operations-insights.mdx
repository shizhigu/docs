## Overview

Operational data is often the richest but least analyzed. SkoutLab helps operations teams find inefficiencies, predict issues, and optimize processes.

## Common Questions

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Efficiency" icon="gauge-high">
    - Where are the bottlenecks?
    - What's causing delays?
    - How can we reduce cycle time?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Quality" icon="check-double">
    - What's driving defects/errors?
    - Where are SLAs at risk?
    - What predicts quality issues?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Capacity" icon="scale-unbalanced">
    - Are we over/under capacity?
    - What's utilization by team/resource?
    - When will we hit limits?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Patterns" icon="chart-scatter">
    - When do issues occur?
    - What's the root cause of recurring problems?
    - Are there hidden correlations?

## Example: Support Operations

**Question asked:**
> "Why has average ticket resolution time increased?"

**What SkoutLab found:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Finding 1: Ticket volume up 45%, staffing up 10%">
    **Status:** Confirmed

    Ticket growth significantly outpaced team growth. Average tickets per agent increased from 28 to 36 per week.

    **Recommended action:** Evaluate hiring plan or explore automation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Finding 2: Complex tickets increasing">
    **Status:** Confirmed

    "Integration" category tickets up 89%, require 3x longer than average. Product launch created new support burden.

    **Recommended action:** Create integration documentation; consider specialist team
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Finding 3: Tier escalations taking longer">
    **Status:** Confirmed

    Time-to-escalation increased from 4 hours to 11 hours. Tier 2 backlog growing.

    **Recommended action:** Review escalation criteria and Tier 2 capacity
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Data You'll Need

| Data | Why It Helps |
|------|--------------|
| **Tickets/Cases** | Support, service requests, incidents |
| **Time tracking** | Cycle times, wait times, resolution times |
| **Resource data** | Team capacity, assignments, utilization |
| **Quality metrics** | Errors, rework, SLA compliance |

## Operations-Specific Analysis

### Process Mining

SkoutLab identifies:
- Actual process flows (vs documented)
- Bottlenecks and delays
- Rework loops
- Handoff inefficiencies

### Predictive Signals

Finds leading indicators:
- What predicts escalation?
- What signals quality issues?
- What drives cycle time?

### Anomaly Detection

Catches operational issues:
- Unusual volumes or patterns
- SLA breach risk
- Capacity constraints

## Tips for Operations Analysis

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Define Metrics" icon="ruler">
    "Resolution time" is clearer than "performance"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Time Boundaries" icon="clock">
    Specify periods for meaningful comparison
  </Card>
  <Card title="Segment by Type" icon="layer-group">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Sample Questions to Try

```
"What's causing delays in our order fulfillment process?"

"Which support ticket types have the lowest customer satisfaction?"

"Are there patterns in when system incidents occur?"

"What predicts whether a ticket will need escalation?"

"Where are we losing time in the customer onboarding process?"
```
