## 1. Connect & Learn

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Data workspace">
    Click **Data** in the sidebar. This is the home for uploads and databases.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a connection">
    Choose **Upload Files** for Excel/CSV/Parquet or **Database** for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MotherDuck, etc. Give each source a descriptive name.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Knowledge Builder">
    Hit **Start Learning** in the Knowledge Builder panel. Agents begin profiling schema, relationships, and data quality while you keep working.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Learning runs in the background. Even if you start an analysis immediately, the system keeps enriching its understanding for future runs.
</Info>

## 2. Ask a Question

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a task">
    From the dashboard, click **New Analysis**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pick sources">
    Select one or more connections. You can mix uploads and live warehouses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe what you need">
    Examples:
    - “Why did revenue drop in Q4 versus Q3?”
    - “Which customer segments are growing fastest?”
    - “Scan our data for anomalies this month.”

    Leave the prompt blank to let agents explore and surface noteworthy stories automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch">
    Click **Analyze**. Parallel agents explore, generate hypotheses, validate them statistically, and capture evidence in the workspace.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Read the Report

| Section | What it tells you |
|---------|------------------|
| **Executive summary** | Top takeaways, impact level, and recommended actions |
| **Findings list** | Hypotheses ranked by significance; click any card for details |
| **Evidence drawer** | Charts, metrics, code snippets, and data samples |

<Tip>
Use **Investigate Further** on any finding to spin up a follow-up analysis with the same context.
</Tip>

## 4. Download or Automate

- **Download evidence packages** to share with engineers or auditors.
- **Schedule** the analysis weekly/monthly to keep stakeholders updated.
- **Keep Knowledge Builder running** so future tasks start with richer context.
