## What is SkoutLab?

SkoutLab is an **Agent-Native** data analysis platform. Instead of building dashboards or writing queries, you simply connect your data and let our AI agents do the work.

## Why Agent-Native?

Traditional BI tools give you **charts**. You still have to figure out what they mean.

SkoutLab gives you **answers**. Our AI agents:

- **Explore** your data like a human analyst would
- **Generate hypotheses** about what's happening
- **Validate** findings with statistical rigor
- **Explain** results in plain language

<Tip>
Think of it as having a tireless data analyst on your team — one who knows your data inside out and proactively finds what you need to know.
