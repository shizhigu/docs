## What You Get

SkoutLab replaces dashboards and ad‑hoc SQL with an **agent-native** workflow:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Data Workspace" icon="database" href="/getting-started/data-workspace">
    Drop in spreadsheets or connect live warehouses. SkoutLab maps tables, relationships, and quality issues for you.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Smart Analysis" icon="sparkles" href="/features/smart-analysis">
    Ask a question (“Why did revenue drop in Q4?”) or let the AI explore. Agents generate hypotheses, run tests, and surface the real drivers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Continuous Learning" icon="brain" href="/features/knowledge-builder">
    Keep the Knowledge Builder running so agents maintain up-to-date schema understanding and context for future analyses.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Actionable Reports" icon="file-chart-column" href="/features/reports">
    Every analysis becomes an executive-ready narrative with evidence, impact, and recommended next steps.
  </Card>

## Why Agent-Native > Traditional BI

Traditional BI gives you **dashboards** and expects you to interpret them. SkoutLab gives you **briefings** backed by data:

- **Explore** – Agents crawl every relevant table and learn normal behavior.
- **Hypothesize** – Potential causes are drafted automatically.
- **Validate** – Statistical tests confirm (or refute) each idea.
- **Explain** – Findings are translated into plain language with recommended actions.

<Tip>
Think of SkoutLab as the analyst who never sleeps: it understands context, keeps historical memory, and keeps iterating when you click “Investigate Further”.
