## The Scientific Method for Business

SkoutLab applies the scientific method to your business data:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Observe">
    Scan data for patterns, anomalies, and potential relationships
  </Step>
  <Step title="Hypothesize">
    Form testable statements about what's happening
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test">
    Apply statistical methods to validate or refute
  </Step>
  <Step title="Report">
    Present findings with evidence and confidence levels
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What is a Hypothesis?

In SkoutLab, a hypothesis is a specific, testable statement about your data:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Good Hypotheses" icon="check">
    - "Revenue declined because Product X underperformed"
    - "Customers who complete onboarding have lower churn"
    - "Sales peak on the last day of each month"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Not Hypotheses" icon="xmark">
    - "Revenue is important" (not testable)
    - "Something is wrong" (too vague)
    - "We should sell more" (opinion)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Hypothesis States

Each hypothesis goes through validation and ends in one of these states:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Confirmed** | Statistical evidence supports the hypothesis |
| **Refuted** | Data contradicts the hypothesis |
| **Inconclusive** | Not enough evidence either way |

### Confirmed

When a hypothesis is confirmed:
- Statistical tests passed significance thresholds
- Effect size is meaningful
- Pattern is consistent across the data

<Info>
SkoutLab uses a significance level of α = 0.05 by default, meaning there's less than 5% probability the finding is due to random chance.
</Info>

### Refuted

A refuted hypothesis is still valuable! It means:
- You can rule out this explanation
- Focus efforts elsewhere
- Avoid acting on false assumptions

### Inconclusive

Sometimes there's not enough data to decide:
- Sample size too small
- Effect size unclear
- Need more time or data

## Statistical Rigor

SkoutLab doesn't just look for patterns — it validates them:

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Significance Testing** | Is this pattern real or random? |
| **Effect Size** | How big is the impact? |
| **Confidence Intervals** | What's the range of uncertainty? |
| **Multiple Testing Correction** | Avoid false positives from many tests |

## From Hypothesis to Action

Each validated hypothesis leads to:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Findings" icon="lightbulb">
    What we discovered
  </Card>
  <Card title="Evidence" icon="chart-line">
    Proof it's real
  </Card>
  <Card title="Actions" icon="list-check">
    What to do about it
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Building Institutional Knowledge

Validated hypotheses are saved and become part of your organization's knowledge:

- **Future analyses** reference past findings
- **Patterns** are tracked over time
- **Anomalies** are flagged when they deviate from known patterns

<Tip>
The more you use SkoutLab, the smarter it gets. Past hypotheses inform future analyses, building compounding returns on your data investment.
