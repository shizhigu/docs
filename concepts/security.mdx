## Our Commitment

Your data is your most valuable business asset. We take its protection seriously.

<Info>
**TL;DR:** Your data is encrypted, isolated, and never shared. We're read-only — we can't modify your source systems.
</Info>

## Data Protection

### Encryption

| Layer | Protection |
|-------|------------|
| **In Transit** | TLS 1.3 encryption for all connections |
| **At Rest** | AES-256 encryption for stored data |
| **Credentials** | Industry-standard secrets management |

### Isolation

- Each customer's data is isolated in separate environments
- No cross-customer data access
- Analysis runs in sandboxed compute environments

### Access Control

- Role-based access within your organization
- Audit logs for all data access
- SSO integration available (Enterprise)

## What We Access

### Read-Only

SkoutLab operates in **read-only mode**:
- We query your data
- We never write, update, or delete
- We can't modify your source systems

### Minimal Access

We only access what's needed:
- Tables/files you explicitly connect
- Metadata for schema understanding
- Query results for analysis

## Data Lifecycle

### Storage

| Data Type | Retention |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Connection credentials** | Until you delete the connection |
| **Analysis results** | Until you delete them |
| **Knowledge/learnings** | Until you delete the connection |
| **Usage logs** | 90 days |

### Deletion

When you delete a connection:
- All associated data is permanently deleted
- Analysis history referencing that data is removed
- Learnings from that data source are erased

<Warning>
Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. Export any reports you need before deleting connections.
</Warning>

## Compliance
